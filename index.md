## Welcome to the Beacon Adventure page

This is checkpoint 3 for the Eddystone beacons. 


### Gamifying beacons

You can gamify beacons by creating checkpoints around a venue or other space for visitors to collect. These can include clues or secret passwords and other bits of information to help gamify your beacons. 

Read more about gamification on the [Edutech wiki](http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Gamification).
